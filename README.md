# Dungeon-game-project

Dungeon game project
The idea is to evently have multiple levels (initial level design is complete and can be edited to make future levels)

currently both alpha and beta without game art 
alpha has the code for treasure but is currently not working 

I'm not currently working on this project, but plan to once I've finished my Portfolio.
